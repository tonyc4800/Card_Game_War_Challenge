# Project Information
This is a War (card game) simulator web application. For information on how war is played click [here](http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/). The main goal of this project was to practice working with a List Collection.  The web application creates two players, Rick and Morty, and deals them their hand of cards. This process is displayed on the webpage as per the instructions. Then the game of War is started. Only 26 rounds of play are simulated. The limit is a requirement of the instructions and it is also due to the fact that an actual game of War could take hours to complete. 

* C# 6.0 syntax used
* Repository contains all files necessary to run the application.
